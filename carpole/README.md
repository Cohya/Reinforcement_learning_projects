# CartPole - using Open AI gym 

(see: https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v1/)

Q-learning along with a linear system to estimate the action-value function, Q(s,a), were used here. 

Required libraries:

1) Numpy 
2) matplotlib
3) gym 
4) pickle (for save/load the weights)


I stop the training right after it achive 20 games with score above 300.
